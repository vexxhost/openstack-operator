                properties:
                  effect:
                    description: Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty
                      means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values
                      are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                    description: Key is the taint key that the toleration applies
                      to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator
                      must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and
                      all keys.

                    description: Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                      Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists
                      is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate
                      all taints of a particular category.

                      toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this
                      field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not
                      set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict).
                      Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately)
                      by the system.

                      If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise
                      just a regular string.
